# Description: This file contains the configuration for the House Heating, which provides a comprehensive 
#              overview of the heating system's operation, electricity costs, and energy consumption. It includes 
#              thermostat controls, price monitoring, and energy usage tracking for manual and automated heating systems.
#
# Features:
#  - Thermostat Control: Displays the central thermostat for controlling home heating settings.
#  - Price Overview: Monitors electricity prices, including current low and high prices, as well as price periods.
#  - Fee and Tax Details: Displays essential cost components such as base fee, fixed price, electricity tax, 
#    and other related charges for heating operation.
#  - Heating Automation Toggle: Provides a button for manually controlling the heating automation system, 
#    allowing users to switch between automatic and manual heating control.
#  - Heating Energy Consumption Graphs: Shows energy usage over time for both manual and automatic heating systems.
#  - Heating System Comparison: Compares energy consumption between the manual and automated heating systems 
#    alongside energy cost tracking.
#
# Notes:
#  - Make sure all entities (e.g., sensors, input_numbers, and custom cards) are configured and functional 
#    to ensure proper display and operation of the heating board.
#  - ApexCharts cards require appropriate sensor data and may not function correctly without valid data points.
#  - For accurate display of energy usage, ensure that the relevant time periods are correctly configured for 
#    graphing and energy consumption tracking.
